                    <h2>Growing Up</h2>
                    <p>I grew up in a desert town outside of Los Angeles. Growing up I played a lot of sports such as
                        Baseball, Football and Wrestling. I also really enjoy music. In my teenage years I played guitar
                        and sang in a punk band. We were terrible but I didn't care, we were playing punk rock and it's
                        suppose to sound terrible. Later in my 20s I got into DJing, and I was pretty good at it. I
                        DJ'ed hundreds of events from the clubs of LA to weddings and corporate events. I even performed
                        with some big-name artists. I also play the piano and make electronic music with my computer,
                        synthesizers, and drum machines.</p>

                    <p class="fam-text">I've moved around all over California but when I met Justina, I knew she was
                        the
                        one and that it was time to put away the turntables and settle down. We got married and decided
                        we
                        wanted to
                        move to Utah. I loved every place I've lived in and made a lot of friends, but I especially love
                        living here in Utah. We are fans of all things outdoors and Utah is the place where we could
                        spend as much time in the wild as we want. So many adventures to seek within minutes. Now we are
                        a growing family with three kids and counting. Here is a picture of me with my wife Justina and
                        three children Landon, Audrey, and our newly born baby Halen, like Van Halen.</p>

                <p>So, the next chapter, getting into a new career. It was my interest in computer music that led me
                    to discover a new passion, computer programming. I am still very much a beginner at it but due
                    to my fascination with what I could do in music production, building out small scripts and
                    devices, I want to be a programmer. With some self-taught skills in Web Development and SEO, I
                    managed to get work with a cool company, Boostability, that focuses on SEO (Search Engine
                    Optimization). Being self-taught I realize I have some gaps in my knowledge and have felt like I
                    hit a wall in my growth. So, I decided to go back to school to learn more about programming.
                    This website was built as a final project to my first class, and I created a page dedicated to
                    my pursuit of what I have learned.</p>

            <section>
                <p>I am constantly looking for new things to learn about and experience. I have a love for life and
                    a heart of gold. This website is just a 1.0 version. Like me, it will continually evolve and
                    adapt to new and better versions. So please, come back occasionally, to see how myself and the
                    website grows.</p>
                <p>Oh, and just last year I took on a new hobby, photography. For being a beginner, I am impressed
                    with myself. You can check out my <a href="photography.html">photography page</a> to see some of
                    my pictures and the gear I
                    use. Most of the pictures I take are landscape, Astro, and milky way photos. I am starting to
                    build up my Instagram account so please <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brady_amerson/"
                        target="_blank">follow me!</a></p>

                <p>As I mentioned on my home page, my hobby in computer music led me into a new passion, computer
                    programming. How? Well, I like to use a program called Ableton Live to make and record music.</p>
                <p>I have been using this program for 20 years. In the early years, it was not as feature robust, but
                    they provided access to a program called Max for Live, a graphical coding environment, sort of like
                    a drag and drop code environment that allowed musicians to build devices to solve issues or create
                    more efficient workflows when making music. I often found myself noodling around and building
                    devices way more than I was making music. So here I am, enrolled at BYUi to pursue a degree in Web
                    Development.</p>

                <p>Now I am taking a course on web fundamentals and learning more about HTML and CSS. This website is my
                    final project. I am also taking a course on Linux and learning how to navigate and create scripts in
                    the shell command line.</p>
                <p>I have learned a lot so far and am looking forward to investing more of my time on this journey of
                    learning. I will update this site with more info as I progress. I want to demonstrate and showcase
                    my newly acquired skills. Here are just a few topics I know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>MySQL</li>
                    <li>WordPress</li>
                    <li>SEO (Search Engine Optimization</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I am constantly looking for new things to learn about and experience. I have a love for life and
                    a heart of gold. This website is just a 1.0 version. Like me, it will continually evolve and
                    adapt to new and better versions. So please, come back occasionally, to see how myself and the
                    website grows.</p>
                <p>Oh, and just last year I took on a new hobby, photography. For being a beginner, I am impressed
                    with myself. You can check out my <a href="photography.html">photography page</a> to see some of
                    my pictures and the gear I
                    use. Most of the pictures I take are landscape, Astro, and milky way photos. I am starting to
                    build up my Instagram account so please <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brady_amerson/"
                        target="_blank">follow me!</a></p>

      <h3>Get to know me!</h3>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Brady and that's my beautiful wife, Justina. Thank you for
        visiting my website. I built it for you to get to know me so it means a
        lot to me that you would stop by.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in a desert town outside of Los Angeles. Growing up I played a
        lot of sports such as Baseball, Football and Wrestling. I also really
        enjoy music. In my teenage years I played guitar and sang in a punk
        band. We were terrible but didn't care much, we were playing punk rock.
        Later in my 20s I got into DJing and I was pretty good at it too. I
        DJ'ed hundreds of events from the clubs of LA to weddings and corporate
        events. I even performed with some big name artists. I also play the
        piano and make electronic music with my computer, synthesizers, and drum
        machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've moved around all over California but when I met Justina, I knew she
        was the one and it was time to put away the turntables and settle down.
        We got married and decided we wanted to move to Utah. Even though I
        loved every place that I lived in and made a lot of friends, I
        especially love living here in Utah. We are fans of all things outdoors
        so we wanted to live in a place where we could spend as much time in the
        wild as possible. Now we are a growing family with three kids and
        counting. Here is a picture of me with my wife Justina and three
        children Landon, Audrey and Halen.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the next chapter, getting into a new career. It was my interest in
        computer music that led me to discover a new passion, computer
        programming. I am still very much a beginner at it but due to my
        fascination with what I could do in music production, building out small
        scripts and devices, I want to be a programmer. With some self-taught
        skills in Web Developement and SEO, I managed to get work with a really
        cool company, Boostability, that focuses on SEO (Search Engine
        Optimization). Being self-taught I realize I have some gaps in my
        knowledge and have felt like I hit a wall in my growth. So I decided to
        go back to school to learn more about programming. This website was
        actually built as a final project to my first class and I created a page
        dedicated to my pursuit of what I have learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and just last year I took on a new hobby, photography. For being a
        begginer I am actually impressed with myself. You can check out my
        photography page to see some of my pictures and the gear I use. Most of
        the pictures I take are landscape, astro and milky way photos. I am
        starting to build up my Instagram account so please
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brady_amerson/" target="_blank"
          >follow me!</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I am constantly looking for new things to learn about and experience. I
        have a love for life and a heart of gold. This website is just a 1.0
        version. Like me, it will continually evolve and adapt to new and better
        version. So please, come back every once in while to see how myself and
        the website grows.

      <h3>Web Developement</h3>
      <p>
        As I mentioned on the landing page, my hobby in computer music led me
        into a new passion, computer programming. How? Well, I like to use a
        program called Ableton Live to make and record music.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been using this program for 20 years. In the early years, it was
        not as feature robust but they provided access to a program called Max
        for Live, a graphical coding environment, sort of like a drag and drop
        code environment that allowed musicians to build devices to solve issues
        or create more efficient work flows when making music. I often found
        myself noodling around and building devices way more than I was actually
        making music. So here I am, enrolled at BYUi to pursue a degree in Web
        Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment I am taking a course on web fundamentals and learning more
        about HTML and CSS. This website is my final project. I am also taking a
        course on Linux and learning how to navigate and create scripts in the
        shell command line. I have learned a lot so far and am looking forward
        to investing more of my time on this journey of learning. I will update
        this site with more info as I progress. I want to demonstrate and
        showcase my newly acquired skills. Here are just a few topics I know:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>MySQL</li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>
        For the last 12 years while living in Utah, I have had an urge to learn
        about photography. Not just a point your phone and push the button kind
        of photography but I really wanted to learn more about how to take good
        pictures. I wanted to get one of those big camera bodies with all the
        buttons on it and learn what each one did. As an avid outdoors guy
        living in Utah, we have some of the best scenery in the world and I want
        to capture it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So last summer I spent too much money and bought a Sony a7 III camera.
        After several hours of watching video tutorials and many days of
        practicing, I finally have some images I feel are worth sharing. I still
        have a lot to learn and hope to evenytually get to a professional level.
      </p>
